									<h2>Overview</h2>

									<p>During my internship with Avanade, I attended their 5th annual Fuel Conference and hackathon.  The prompt was to <strong>solve a problem using AI</strong>.
									On a team of four with one mentor, we created <strong>MyTA</strong>, an automated grading system to help teachers grade assignments with speed and accuracy, all with the click of a camera button.  MyTA also uses an algorithm to pick up patterns for any students that may be struggling and can provide resources to help.
									I helped create a <strong>prototype app</strong>, completely done in <strong>Figma</strong> with the help of one other team member.  Using our design and initial functionality, I introduced the phone model to <strong>180+ people</strong> as a part of our final presentation.</p>
									<p>Our project went through three rounds of judges and won <strong>1st place</strong> among 72 other teams!</p>

											<h2>Tools</h2>
											<p>Based on the hackathon prompt, we concluded on using the tools:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Figma</li>
												<li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
												<li>Microsoft Teams</li>
											</ul>
										</div>

										<div class="col-4 col-12-small">
											<h2>Team</h2>
											<p>In our team of 5, we organized ourselves into these roles:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>2 UI Designers</li>
												<li>2 Researchers</li>
												<li>1 Mentor</li>
											</ul>
										</div>

										<div class="col-4 col-12-small">
											<h2>My Role</h2>
											<p>As one of the UI Designers, my role contained the following:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Creating the MyTA prototype using Figma</li>
												<li>Presenting our project with another team member</li>
												<li>Communicating with researchers</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>Problem</h2>
											<p>The hackathon took place over a series of days with only a few hours each to meet with our team and work on the project.
												During this, I faced a number of <strong>technology problems with team assignments</strong>.  The first day I was placed on a team completely by myself, and got moved to a partially full team with only one hour left to discuss.  The second day everyone on the team I was assigned to the previous day got moved to different teams, and I was by myself once again while losing even more time.
											</p>
										</div>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h2>Solution</h2>
											<p>When reaching out for help with my team assignment the second time, one of my coworkers that I had previously acquainted with <strong>invited me to join</strong> his team.  From here, I <strong>quickly pivoted</strong> to their project idea and started working right away on the Figma prototype, which was greatly improved with my help.  Additionally, due to the lost time, I <strong>worked extra hours</strong> on the prototype and perfecting presentation.</p>

											<h2>UI Design</h2>
											<p>Once team assignment issues were resolved and we had a solid idea, I moved on to design the final app prototype in Figma.  
												My goal was to create a user interface that was direct and can be easily organized and understood with no prior knowledge. </p>
											<ul>
												<li>Flat visual style with color coding for a sleek modern design with easy organization</li>
												<li>Followed iOS Style Guide to match the style and  functionality with our target device</li>
												<li>Designed for smartphones, particularly iPhones, for easy accessibility in the most common device with a easily portable camera and speaker</li>

									<h2>Next Steps</h2>
									<p>While this project is concluded, some next steps I wish I had gotten the time for was <strong>improving the UI design</strong> and <strong>increasing functionality</strong>.  Although it was impressive to have a working prototype with an entire interface that no other team had, at first glance the UI looks outdated and the functionality is very limited.</p>
									<p>In terms of the UI, some simple changes I would make to this is getting rid of the black outline around the color coded boxes, as it does not appear as sleek and modern as a lineless boxes do.  Additionally, while the color coding is a useful idea, it would stay more true to the brand identity if,  instead of using a rainbow color palette, we instead used shades of red, orange, and blue to match the logo and give the pages the same overall look and feel.  Lastly, most of the interface is built upon drop down menus, if I were to go back and made edits, I would make less of the display dependent on the user having to interact by clicking, and at the least have some permanent displays, as each page should not have the capability of being almost entirely empty when all of the drop down menus are closed.</p>
									<p>Aside from these fixes, if I could go back to this project I would greatly increase the functionality of the Figma prototype.  The drop down menus and other aspects (such as the camera), are entirely stagnant displays, and a display of the functionality by being able to actually interact with the prototype would greatly increase the expression of the vision for MyTA to those outside our group.</p>

									<h2>Learnings</h2>
									<p>Overall, this experience taught me a lot about <strong>UI design</strong>, <strong>client communication</strong>, and <strong>using Figma</strong>.  This was my first major time using Figma and I was surprised how excited and passionate I got working with the program and how I was able to quickly help concept designs and automatically create them in our prototype.  This helped me grow not only as a designer but also as a teammate, and our 1st place win demonstrates the work that was put in.  While the project is now concluded, I will use the skills I have learned to guide me in every opportunity ahead.</p>
