										<h1>TransFam Graphic Design</h1>

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>This client was the president of TransFam, a club focused on helping transgender students find community and resources that are available around ASU. Being the graphic designer of this club, they requested me to create and design a series of <strong>simple slide backgrounds</strong> that can be used for meeting presentations, containing: <strong>light and dark themes, the TransFam logo,</strong> and <strong>transgender motifs</strong> that aren't too attention grabbing</p>

											<h2>Tools</h2>
											<p>Based on this description, I concluded on using the tools:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
												<li>Google Slides</li>
												<li>Microsoft PowerPoint</li>
											</ul>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h2>My Role</h2>
											<p>Because this was an individual project, I assumed these roles:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Concept Artist</li>
												<li>Presentation Designer</li>
												<li>Client Consultant</li>
											</ul>

									<h2>Design Process</h2>
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-8 col-12-small">
											<p>As a transgender person myself, I wanted to make sure that the designs I created were an accurate tribute to the overall transgender experience, so that any transgender individual could look at the design and automatically know the meaning behind it, all while being sleek and modern.</p>
											<p>My starting point in doing this was to incorporate the transgender flag into my designs.  Doing this would automatically give me a transgender focused color palette that is easily recognizable by the community and contributes well to the overall design.  Additionally, these colors matched with the TransFam logo that was required to be included in the designs.</p>
											<p>Now that I knew I wanted to use the flag, I wanted a way to make the flag smoother and easier to the eye.  My solution to this was to blur the colors in the flag, creating a pleasing gradient that moves seamlessly through each color that assists the aesthetic instead of hindering it with drawing too much attention away from the logo on content of the slides.</p>
											<p>After creating the flag gradient, I came up with some ideas on how to include it in a both minimal and creative way.  My final idea for this was creating ribbon-like wavy lines using the gradient transgender flag's colors.  Using Photoshop, I created three smooth line designs, as well as a curved header.  Then, on the slides I used these assets and found the best ways to lay them together to have the lines interact dynamically and the headers and logo placed correctly.  This process required horizontally flipping, slight rotating, and resizing the assets as needed.  I concluded with four final designs, and provided them in both dark and light themes, along with an assets slide.</p>

									<h2>Next Steps</h2>
									<p>Although this project has been finished and is not able to be changed, some things I would adjust if given the opportunity would be <strong>redoing the lines</strong>.  Though the concept for the ribbon-like lines is strong in terms of its duality in creative flair and minimal attention demands, the execution of creating the lines themselves could be improved.</p>
									<p>While designing the lines, I was using a canvas that was not as wide horizontally as the slides.  This resulted in having to heavily stretch each line when used in the final product in order for it to meet both ends.  This stretching resulted in lines that felt flatter and thicker, that opposes its original intent.  Therefore, redoing these lines on the correct sized canvas so they do not have to be stretched would result in lines that not only interact more seamlessly but can be more dynamic in their design while still looking light.</p>

									<h2>Learnings</h2>
									<p>Through the process of bringing this project to completion I learned <strong>effective brainstorming</strong>, <strong>conceptual design follow-through</strong>, <strong>client communication</strong>, and <strong>Photoshop skills improvement</strong>.  While I have used Photoshop and designed presentation slides in my past, this was the first time it was done for personal use, and I was able to use all of the skills gained on my own to provide a result that the client loved.  Overall, while I wanted to redo the lines and make each slide perfect, I did not have the time for that given the deadline; however, the client directly told me she loved it and didn't need anything to be changed or edited.  This helped me understand the lesson that sometimes efficiency is just as important as the final result, and it all depends on what is best for the client.</p>
									<p>Upon sending the results to the client, she said that the designs perfectly encapsulated the mission of the club and would be used for all future meetings.</p>
