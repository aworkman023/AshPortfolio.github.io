									<h2>Overview</h2>

									<p>In the class CIS 440: Computer Information Systems Capstone, students were split into teams and were to complete a project using <strong>agile/scrum methodology</strong> with the theme of <strong>mentorship</strong>.  During the 8 weeks of this project, students must <strong>fulfill their assigned scrum role</strong>, <strong>create 9 user stories</strong>, <strong> complete weekly check ins</strong>, <strong>build a system from scratch connected to the front end and back end from start to finish</strong>, and <strong>do a final presentation</strong>.</p>
									<p>Our group chose to build <strong>Mentors & Mentees</strong>.  This system streamlines the process of matching mentors and mentees together based on customizable profiles that list work style, coding languages, traits, availability, and location.  Paired with secure user accounts, in-depth registration surveys, social media embedment, and a request system— this makes finding a mentor or mentee simpler and easier for everyone involved.</p>

											<h2>User Stories</h2>

											<p>In the process of defining the layout and functionality of the project, we created 9 user stories that describe features of the software from the perspective of the end user.  Each story also contains a point value and at least three criteria to meet in order to be marked as done.</p>
											<p>The user stories, pain points, major features, and website layout are outlined in the planning document which can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11Gody0uJP4pKFIYTpgnouFr5sy8WBwzu4U7AbUpZLWY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

											<h2>Problem</h2>
											<p>Throughout the course of this project, there were many struggles with <strong>teammate participation</strong>.  Nearing the end of the last semester, motivation was very low, sickness was recurring, and students were frequently skipping classes that were designated to meet with the team and discuss what needed to be done for the next sprint.  It is due to these reasons that at almost every single class meeting there was at least one member of the group missing.</p>
										</div>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h2>Solution</h2>
											<p>Due to the frequent absences of team members and inability to switch to virtual or issue any real incentives or punishments for not attending, the best solution was to accommodate the students that missed class.  To do this, after every class session I—as the product owner—would <strong>send a summary</strong> of what was covered at the meeting, what progress was made, what progress still needs to occur.  I also provided <strong>direct assignments</strong> on what those who were absent needed to catch up on, specifically outlining the criteria needed to be met for it to be done.</p>

									<h2>Next Steps</h2>
									<p>Although the project has ended, next steps I would have taken if allotted extra time is to add <strong>a profile picture</strong>, <strong>a request system</strong>, and <strong>profile editing seamlessness</strong>.  While I'm proud of the work my group has done in creating a fully functional program with front end, back end, and a database in a short amount of time, the actual experience for the end user is quite limited.</p>
									<p>Adding a profile picture is a small but very impactful part of a software like this one, as it gives users a sense of self expression and ability to customize their profile and experience.  If we had added the choice to upload a file in the initial profile creation form, we could have used that to give the platform itself and each user some variety.</p>
									<p>In the preliminary brainstorming of this project, we included a request system for users.  This system would have allowed users to request to be another user's mentor or mentee, and the receiving user could have accepted or denied that request.  Upon acceptance, they would be directed to the requesting user's LinkedIn or other social platform that has a messaging system in place.  This idea tied the whole program together and really focused on user benefit, however, due to the short deadline and inconsistent meeting it has to be cut.</p>
									<p>Lastly, while the profile editing process works, it sends users back to the "Create Profile" page with a completely blank form.  A simple but very helpful addition to this would be to have the form prefilled with their information, so the user does not have to redo the entire form just to correct one field.</p>

									<h2>Learnings</h2>
									<p>Overall, this project taught me about <strong>being the manager and leader of a team using agile/scrum methodology</strong>, and <strong>connecting front end and back end code with a database</strong>.  Due to the aforementioned frequent absences, being the product owner taught me the importance of time management and taking initiative in solving problems.  Though I have had previous experience and knowledge with agile/scrum through a previous project and internship, it was a new experience to fill the role of product owner and have to direct and lead others in the group to get work done, when I am typically used to being the worker.  It was very educational to set up in stand up meetings, assign different responsibilities based on each team member's roles, be the presenter in check in meetings, and build one program as a group.  The Mentors & Mentees project containing everything outlined above earned a score of 100%, further displaying the application of these concepts and practices.</p>
