									<h2>Overview</h2>

                                    <p>During my senior year at ASU, I took the class <strong>Game Development I</strong>, which consisted of learning the introductory skills needed to make video games with GameMaker.  Throughout this class, I programmed a clicker game, a shooter game, an endless runner game, and an adventure game all through GameMaker language and using open game art assets.</p>
                                    <p>The course also contained a semester-long group project of creating your own original game using the concepts learned in class or on your own.  With the help of my team, we created <strong>Creature Crusaders</strong>, a <strong>multi-level platformer</strong> with completely original <strong>art</strong> and <strong>storyline</strong>.  The game follows secret animal agents who have the ability to shapeshift and use their natural abilities to avoid obstacles and enemy bugs.</p>
                                    <p>Our finished product of Creature Crusaders was submitted to <strong>ASU's Game 1 - Fa2023 Showcase</strong> and is one of the most <strong>top rated</strong> games in this showcase.</p>

                                            <h2>Planning</h2>
                                            <p>The first and foremost step in creating a video game is brainstorming and planning.  The first two weeks were dedicated solely to coming up with an idea and planning out how to approach the rest of the project.</p>
                                            <p>After forming a group, the first thing that was created was a team server on <strong>Discord</strong> that could be used as our main source of communication outside of class.  Discord also has voice chat, channels, and threads capabilities to keep our progress well documented and organized.  The Discord was used mainly to outline exactly what needs to get done and who it is assigned to, and to update when the process was not started, in progress, or completed.</p>
                                            <p>It was during this time that we created the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ttlIYOZN0tdWZA7in6pLcLCUg4i3ImX_qroTg128Pog/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Pitch Doc</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1307Hqj119xphZ8xRP54h63vPLk1val74nWlGJ0NC6Po/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Design Doc</a> to solidify the idea and document all the nitty-gritty details that may not have been discussed in the general idea creation.  Additionally, these documents outlined our plan and could be used as a continuous reference throughout the development process.</p>
                                            <p>As seen in these documents, there is already some official art contained within the text.  I started the art process as soon as an idea was formed because I knew how long art and animation takes, especially with a very character-heavy and animation based game.</p>
                                            <p><strong>Disclaimer: The documents have some contradicting information compared to the final game outcome because it was created so early in the process.</strong></p>

                                    <h2>Artwork</h2>
                                    <div class="row">
										<div class="col-8 col-12-small">
                                        <p>All artwork and visuals for Creature Crusaders was created entirely from scratch, nothing was taken from open source resources or the internet.</p>
                                        <p>In the art I created, I drew everything on my computer using a Wacom tablet on <strong>Adobe Animate</strong>.  In using this software I was able to draw the non-moving assets and the animations all in one place, making it easy to keep the same style and colors.  While Adobe Animate was a convenient program as it is meant for animations, it also had many limitations that took extra time and removed the capability to work as efficiently.  
                                            The first issue was the lack of a "magic wand" selection tool, as Adobe Animate focuses on quick coloring on the same layer as the linework, which I avoided in case of unexpected circumstances within the team and the game idea.  This caused me to have to manually outline each area I wanted filled in with a certain color separately, for every frame, then fill it in with the paint bucket.  
                                            Secondly, when creating assets for one direction I had to create them for the other direction as well.  To do this, I horizontally mirrored every frame in the animation, however there was no way to do this quickly to all frames using the program, instead I had to manually highlight every layer in the frame then mirror it.  
                                            Lastly, the way the game was programmed in GameMaker, it was essential that all animations be uploaded one frame at a time instead of as a GIF, so much like mirroring, I manually had to export, rename, and resize each frame for an animation upon finishing.  While these steps are relatively minor, each walking animation was around 7 frames and each jumping animation was around 8 frames, which adds to 15.  Multiplying this by every character I animated is roughly 110 frames to manually color, mirror, and export which results in a lot of lost time when added up.</p>
                                        <p>When the artwork was  successfully exported, it was uploaded onto the team's <strong>Google Drive</strong> that was organized into folders to make it easily used and understood for both artists uploading and coders downloading.</p>
                                        <p>If resizing was ever needed, it was done through <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> and most commonly was used to size characters and backgrounds smaller to keep them in proportion with the rest of the game and prevent the game file from being too big to upload (which did happen before).  Once a an agreed upon pixel size for each category was determined and agreed upon, resizing was not used as frequently.</p>
                                        <p>My teammate and the other artist on the Creature Crusaders team used <strong>Procreate</strong> for all of their artwork and utilized that program's many brush features that explains the textures and shading compared to the style I used, which is especially prevalent in the backgrounds.</p>
                                        <p>I did the following visual art:</p>

											<h2>Problem</h2>
                                            <p>Due to the fact I was the first one to start working on the artwork of the playable characters, I determined the visual style to be simplistic and cartoony, with thick black outlines, solid coloring, and a particular style of eyes and hat that was consistent across each animal.  However, when my teammate created the deer and the backgrounds, these <strong>art styles heavily differentiated</strong>.  The backgrounds were much more realistic, with textures, shading, and light sources which contradicted the style of the characters I had finished beforehand.   Additionally, the deer character stuck out in that it did not follow the aforementioned guidelines that I had followed in every playable character thus far.  In one of the check-ins, the instructor mentioned that the visuals looked like it was done by three different people, and I absolutely agreed and had mentioned this previously amongst my team members.</p>

											<h2>Solution</h2>
                                            <p>In an attempt to fix this issue quickly as we were still short on time, I suggested <strong>converting all assets to pixel art</strong>, to give it a consistent looking medium and it theoretically could cover the differentiated styles as there is not as much freedom in the style.  With a team vote it was agreed on, and I started converting the assets to be pixelated.  However, the conversion process, it was quickly realized that this method <strong>did not fix the issues</strong>, as the style differences could still easily be seen despite the pixelated nature.</p>
                                            <p>The idea of pixel art conversion was scrapped, and instead we decided to simply <strong>adjust the biggest issues</strong> in style differences: the background and the deer.  My teammate <strong>adjusted the deer</strong> to follow the style of other characters better, and <strong>new backgrounds were created</strong> that focused on a more cartoony style.  However, these backgrounds ended up looking worse when put in the game, and often distracted the player from the foreground, so it was voted to scrap these backgrounds as well and go back to the original while the new deer stayed.  To add to the black outline consistency in the foreground, I <strong>outlined all of the platform assets</strong> with black as well, which stayed in the final version.</p>

                                            <p>In spite of the initial planning done at the beginning of the game's development process, there were still a lot of factors up in the air.  It was more often than not that many people on the team were not on the same page about fully understanding the game concept with all of the new ideas being floated around.  It became apparent that we needed to finalize decisions as it was hindering our ability to estimate how much time we needed in comparison to how much we had left.</p>
                                            <p>In order to solve this issue, we created the "voting-to-keep" channel on the Discord server.  Here we determined if specific factors of the game would be removed in favor of time.  Teammates could vote by using the respective emojis mentioned in the message, a green checkmark or a red X.  Most of the voting was unanimous in terms of removing certain factors, but there were some outliers and some times not all of the team voted even when they were notified.  
                                                Generally speaking, this method helped pin-point our game idea much more than we had in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ttlIYOZN0tdWZA7in6pLcLCUg4i3ImX_qroTg128Pog/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Pitch Doc</a> and the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1307Hqj119xphZ8xRP54h63vPLk1val74nWlGJ0NC6Po/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Design Doc</a> and made sure we could fairly keep moving with the changes as every team member had a say.</p>

											<h2>Problem</h2>
                                            <p>Throughout the process of developing Creature Crusaders, <strong>two team members gradually stopped participating</strong>.  The team member assigned to creating the level design and the team member assigned to creating or finding music and SFX both did not participate in the work the others were doing on the game.  Eventually both members stopped coming to class and responding in the Discord server all together.</p>
                                            <p>At this point the three of us, two artists and one coder, were incredibly pressed on time with the huge project art and coding wise, and had to pick up the slack of two team members who were not contributing.</p>
                                        </div>

										<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
											<h2>Solution</h2>
                                            <p>Despite calling out the non-participating members by name to ask what they had done thus far and how they would contribute in the future as the rest of us had a lot on our plate, they both came up short.  The last class before our project was due, I met with the remaining participating team members and created a specific list outlining everything we had left to do on the game and who would do it.  After getting approval from the others, I <strong>sent the to-do list into the Discord and specifically tagged each person</strong> who it was assigned to, including myself.  In the tasks assigned to the two non-participating team members, I also <strong>assigned backups</strong> in case they were not done, which came in handy at the very end.</p>
                                            <p>In addition, the class offered <strong>group evaluations</strong> that have been stressed since the first day of class.  In these evaluations, depending on how your team ranks your participation your personal grade is affected and can deduct points up to the very first assignment if needed.  In these group evaluations, the participating team members and I were honest, explaining the situation and able to provide proof if needed of their lack of effort even when given the direct chance to defend themselves or redeem themselves at the end of the project.</p>

									<h2>Next Steps</h2>
                                    <p>Creature Crusaders had a hard deadline that was unable to be adjusted, because of this what has been submitted can no longer be edited with its submission and team contributions now that the class has been concluded.  That being said, if I was to do this project again, some things I would change are <strong>doing all of the art by scratch</strong>, <strong>adjusting last minute errors</strong>, and <strong>participating in coding more</strong>.</p>
                                    <p>While the artwork in this project is a huge part of its charm, it was also its biggest drawback.  The artwork was by far the main reason we were so pressed on time, as we created every asset used in the game completely from scratch.  However, part of the problem in this issue is that the way the project was assigned we thought we <em>had</em> to, and therefore never considered using open art especially for pieces like the backgrounds and platforms that really would have benefited from the saved time.</p>
                                    <p>In the chaos of all of the last-minute finishing touches of the game, there were a few minor issues that never got resolved.  The most noticeable of these issues was the platform assets being mixed with the old pixelated platforms.  It can be missed during the gameplay as there are so many moving characters as well as the camera, but when focused on the sides of any platforms it is clear to see the sharp pixels on the curved edges.  The pixels feel out of place in a visual aesthetic that does not involve any pixels, so even such a small factor like pixelated edges can throw off the consistent look and feel of the entire game when noticed.</p>
                                    <p>Lastly, this project could have been adjusted in many ways in the planning state to manage our time and skills better.  Because our idea was so art heavy and we had two non-participating team members it made sense that most of my time went into creating the art.  If I did not have the main role as an artist and manage the team as I did, the game simply would not have gotten finished.  Unfortunately, that also meant that any other skills I could have put into this project were not utilized, particularly in coding.  My original intention was to finish all of the art around the halfway point and then help with coding for the second half, however the time estimate was not accurately estimated and it was not accounted for to essentially lose two team members.  Due to these factors, by the end of the project I wasn't able to participate in the coding at all, which is one of my biggest regrets in the development process as it could've been a huge learning opportunity and my previous coding experience could have sped up the process.</p>

									<h2>Learnings</h2>
                                    <p>In retrospect, this project taught me the most about <strong>video game design/development</strong>, <strong>managing team members</strong>, and <strong>using GameMaker Studio</strong>.  While I had made individual games throughout the course, I never fully grasped how complex and vigorous game making can be until this project.  Even despite all of the issues we had along the way, this game contains an exponential amount of code, artwork, communication, time, and passion all rolled up into it.  Creature Crusaders was submitted to ASU's Game 1 - Fa2023 Showcase and I believe that all of this energy shines through in how it is one of the most top rated games in this showcase.</p>
